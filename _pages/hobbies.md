# TTRPG
TTRPG is the category of games like "Dungeons and Dragons", games which are somewhere in between board games and make-believe collaborative storytelling.
I'm an avid TTRPG player—mostly as a player, though I've occasionally stepped in as GM. I play with friends on weekends across a variety of systems.

Check out [Final Pulse](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/515985/final-pulse), a homebrew rulebook for Vampire the Masquerade created by my GM.

# Improv
I've taken a few improv classes, and it's been an absolute blast.  
If you're a Hebrew speaker and want to see me having fun on stage, you can check out my end-of-course performances:
